Analysis for experimental results in which mice were treated with 9 differents drugs (Capomulin, Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Naftisol , Propriva, Ramicane, Stelasyn, Zoniferol) and Placebo. The tumor volume and metastatic sites were recorded every five days for each mouse which survived during the 45-day treatment.
